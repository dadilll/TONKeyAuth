**Status:** ⚠️ Work in progress — this project is an early-stage prototype. Not ready for production use.

## Project Idea

TON OAuth is a prototype OAuth service designed for authentication via **TON blockchain wallets**. The main idea is to allow users to log in to web applications or services using their TON wallet instead of traditional usernames and passwords.  

Core concept:
- Users generate a **challenge** from the service.
- They sign the challenge using their **TON wallet**.
- The service verifies the signature and issues a **JWT** for authentication.
- Public keys are provided via **JWKS** for external services to validate tokens.

This project is primarily an **experimental MVP**, aiming to explore **Web3 authentication concepts** using TON wallets. Security, full anonymity, and fraud-proof verification are **not fully implemented** yet.
